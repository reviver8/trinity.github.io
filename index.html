    <h2>Universal Healthcare Coverage (i.e. UHC)</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
      The Covid-19 pandemic exposed the Achilles' Heel of the world- healthcare. There is a great deficit of healthcare for the hundreds of millions of those who need it. Implementing universal healthcare coverage worldwide is the probable solution to this. 

      Universal healthcare coverage is a system where there would be free healthcare provided for everyone. That means families with physical or mental disabilities don't have to suffer through financial hardship to fight for their quality of life.
      
      <br> <br> Universal healthcare coverage is a worldwide issue that could benefit hundreds of millions of people, at least 930 million people according to the World Health Organization <a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/universal-health-coverage#tab=tab_1" id="WHO">(WHO).</a> Many first world countries, like Germany and Switzerland, are leading the way in universal healthcare coverage around the world. But with other world leaders, such as the United States of America and China, not completely implementing free healthcare into their citizens' birthrights, other countries could use that as an excuse to not have free healthcare for their citizens.

    <h2>50% of the world...</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
      According to the World Bank and WHO, at least half of the world does not have access to essential health services (2017). And <strong>930 million</strong> people have to spend 10% of their household income on healthcare (WHO). That is absurd when drug and medical companies have shown that their companies would still function well without having to charge thousands of dollars for life-giving medications and serivces.
